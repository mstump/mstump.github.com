title: Don't Start a Company
categories : [misc]
---

I can't start that new company. I don't know how to do sales. I don't know how to dev. I don't understand business. I don't understand financing. I don't have enough money saved. The economy isn't doing well. I don't have enough time to work on my idea. Family life is too hectic. I'm the sole breadwinner. I've got young kids at home. Things are really interesting at work. I want to finish this one project. A bunch of people left and the team depends on me. A raise is right around the corner. Things are getting better. There is too much uncertainty. I'm scared.

## It's Never A Good Time
I'm not dismissing your reasons for not starting a company. You may have very valid reasons for not wanting to jump ship. Who am I to judge? The truth is, it's never a good time to start a company. Life is never going to offer up that opportune time where all the planets align and all obstacles melt before you. Being successful is about making the best out of the hand you're given. It's about being determined/persistant/foolhardy enough to push through adversity and do what's difficult.

Two days after I quit my cushy corporate job my wife gave birth to our first son. Yeah, it's been less than ideal and at times, it sucks. No matter what you do you are either neglecting your family or your business. My cofounder is the breadwinner for his family of three, and I guarantee that fact weighs on his conscious all the time. Both of us had jobs which paid us well, had coworkers we liked, and we were respected. I'm not telling you these things to show you how awesome we are, I'm telling you so that you know you're not alone.

## Don't Wait
If you're waiting for someone to tell you it's going to be ok, and everything will work out, that person isn't coming. You're going to have to take that leap on your own. Be under no illusions, starting a company is hard. It's the hardest thing I've done. In fact, it is the hardest thing I've done other than be a parent. But, if you have the stamina, the determination, and the will, do it.

What's the worst that can happen?

If you fail, you haven't. You have attempted something that few are willing to try. You can always get a corporate job and you will never say to yourself, "what if?"
